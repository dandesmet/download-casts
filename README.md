# download-casts
Chrome extension to add download links to the PocketCasts web client (<https://play.pocketcasts.com>) 
to download mp3s of the episodes.  This is especially useful for subscribers of premium podcasts who'd
like to keep personal copies of old episodes.

The extension works by using jquery to examine the DOM and extract the episode URLs.  Contributions 
welcome.
